Board used:Arduino UNO

Software used:Arduino IDE to dump the code to the board.

I've tried to simulate a water management system in dams.

The general idea is to distribute water equally among 2 dams intersecting at a point.

The water is distributed from the overflowing dam to the dry dam/stream.

I've used beakers to simulate dams and level sensor to get the amount of water present in a dam at a certain time.
